— What is Region of Zombies?
Region of Zombies is a vigorous clash of zombies and smilies.

Zombify every single smiley and form your own tribe of zombies. The smilies look like innocent harmless cuties, but they might turn out to be beastly. Don't let them endear your with their cuteness.

— Evolution
When you start the program and click your right mouse button, the evolution begins.

Want to pause the evolution? Click the right mouse button once again.

Zombies is an immensely important part of this world, but aside from them there is also such species as smilies.
They incessantly consume plants, consume each other, procreate and evolve. Remember, only the fittest species survives.

— Smilies
The smilies have the following properties:
* Speed
* Vision distance: how far the smiley can see
* Energy: eating plants/smilies augments the energy; higher vision distance/speed => higher energy consumption; zero energy means the cessation of smiley's life
* Procreation threshold: how much energy is required for the smiley to procreate
* Food preference: whether the smiley prefers to eat plants or other smilies

The descendants inherit the properties of their predecessor with a small deviation.
The smilies which have black eyes and black mouth are the smart smilies. Their algorithm of finding food is more advanced.

— Zombies
The zombies are the descendants of the zombie boss. The zombies boss is what is controlled by you.

When a zombie boss collides with a smiley, the smiley turns into a zombie.
Subsequently, this new member of the family of zombies can zombify other smilies.

Instead of energy, normal zombies and the zombie boss have health (the health of the zombie boss can be seen in the top right corner). Both normal zombies and the zombie boss receive health zombifying smilies.

Both normal zombies and the zombie boss lose health colliding with the plants. In addition, the zombie boss does lose health on vision distance and speed.

— Plants
Plants are merely stationary objects which can be eaten by smilies and trodden by normal zombies and the zombie boss, but smilies receive energy, whereas normal zombies and the zombie boss lose health.
